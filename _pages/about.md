I am an Assistant Professor at [The Zhejiang University-University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Institute (ZJUI)](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en), Zhejiang University.  
I was a Project Assistant Professor at the [Kabashima Lab](https://kaba-lab.org/en/) in the [Institute for Physics of Intelligence (i π)](https://www.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/lp/ipi/), [The University of Tokyo (UTokyo)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) from April 2022 to March 2023.  
I completed my Ph.D. in 2016 from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by [Jianhua Lu](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1167/93854.htm).  
I received a B.E. from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn) in 2011.  

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher in [i π](https://www.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/lp/ipi/), [UTokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) under supervision of [Yoshiyuki Kabashima](https://researchmap.jp/yoshiyuki.kabashima?lang=en) from April 2020 to March 2022, and a postdoctoral researcher in the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io), RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project ([RIKEN-AIP](https://www.cs.washington.edu/)) under supervision of [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io) from July 2019 to March 2020.  

I was a visiting researcher at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Institute (UIUC) from August 2023 to December 2023, hosted by [Zhi-Pei Liang](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/z-liang).  

I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning, information theory, and statistical mechanics, with a special focus on graphical models, Bayesian inference, and learning algorithms.
